### Hexagonal Architecture Plugin

## How to use

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.22"
    id("io.github.fpiechowski.hex.plugin")
}

hex {
    portName.set("port") // optional
    domainName.set("domain") // optional
    adapterName.set("adapter") // optional
}

```

Then move your source files to one of the source sets:
* `main` - entrypoint to your application, it will have access to both `domain` and `adapter` sources
* `domain` - all your application logic and data types, also there is a subdirectory `port` for your interfaces and typealiases, it won't have access to other sources
* `adapter` - all your technical and infrastructure components, it will have access to `domain`

When declaring dependencies you need to decide for which source set it is defined and which type of sources you need a dependency on.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("xxx:yyy:zzz:vvv")
    domainImplementation("xxx:yyy:zzz:vvv")
    adapterImplementation("xxx:yyy:zzz:vvv")
}
```

If you want to declare dependency on just adapter or domain sources you need to publish JARs created for these source sets and use their artifacts as dependencies.

In case you use Gradle multiproject build you can specify configuration name to use as the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    adapterImplementation(project("nested", configuration = "adapterImplementation")) // depending on adapter is not recommended, do it only if you wish to extend the adapter
}
```

Specifying source set when declaring dependencies makes sense only if you want to add `adapterImplementation` to your
project, as `domainImplementation` configuration is by default added to main build output, so adding dependency on
`project("nested")` (or the default artifact from repository) always adds `main` and `domain` sources.

## Composite Build ðŸ“¦

This plguin is using a [Gradle composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) to build, test and publish the plugin. This means that you don't need to run Gradle twice to test the changes on your Gradle plugin (no more `publishToMavenLocal` tricks or so).

The included build is inside the [plugin-build](plugin-build) folder.

### `preMerge` task

A `preMerge` task on the top level build is already provided in the plugin. This allows you to run all the `check` tasks both in the top level and in the included build.

You can easily invoke it with:

```
./gradlew preMerge
```

If you need to invoke a task inside the included build with:

```
./gradlew -p plugin-build <task-name>
```


## Publishing

This plugin is ready to let you publish to [Gradle Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

The [![Publish Plugin to Portal](https://github.com/cortinico/hex-gradle-plugin/workflows/Publish%20Plugin%20to%20Portal/badge.svg?branch=1.0.0)](https://github.com/cortinico/hex-gradle-plugin/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Plugin+to+Portal%22) Github Action will take care of the publishing whenever you **push a tag**.

## 100% Kotlin

This plugin is designed to use Kotlin everywhere. The build files are written using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

Moreover, a minimalistic Gradle Plugin is already provided in Kotlin to let you easily start developing your own around it.

## Static Analysis

This plugin is using [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) with the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This plugin is also using [**detekt**](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).

## CI

This plugin is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-plugin/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this plugin.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `preMerge` tasks as well as trying to run the Gradle plugin.
- [Publish to Plugin Portal](.github/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml) - Will run the `publishPlugin` task when pushing a new tag.
